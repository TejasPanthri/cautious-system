                        <p>Every person who earns a salary above a certain threshold must pay income
                            tax every month. Even self-employed people and professionals must pay
                            income tax if their income falls in the tax bracket. Similarly, companies pay
                            corporate tax to the government. And then there are a host of other taxes, from
                            customs duties to the goods and services tax, and so on.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Tax collections form a majority of the Indian government’s revenue. A hole in tax
                            collections can leave a country vulnerable to economic, political and social instability,
                            which can have severe consequences. </p>

                            What are the Types of Taxes?
                        </h2>
                        <br>
                        <p>Broadly speaking, taxes in India are divided into two categories—Direct Taxes and Indirect
                            Taxes.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h2>Direct taxes</h2>
                        <br>
                        <p>This is the tax levied directly on individuals, corporations, or other kinds of firms. A
                            direct tax cannot be shifted to someone else and the entity or individual earning the income
                            or owning the asset is responsible for paying it. In India, the Central Board of Direct
                            Taxes looks after the implementation of the rules governing the direct taxes.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h2>Types of direct taxes</h2>

                            fund units and real estate. Its imposition depends on the time for which the asset has been
                            held. Its rate is usually lower than peak income tax rate and the government may also allow
                            some setoff in case of real estate.</p>
                        <br>

                        <p>India brought a unified Goods and Services Tax, or GST, regime in 2017 that subsumed most
                            indirect taxes.</p>
